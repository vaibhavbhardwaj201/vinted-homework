I made this project using Vite, you can run this project by running "npm install" and then "npm run dev" command


Here I am writing description of my code and Ideas how we can improve this

1. I used Flickr API as it was recommended, but there are some limitations of this API. It only provides title of images and sometimes empty title.
So, in case title is not present, it will print "Not Available". And as design provided in assignment, Author name is not available by api, so i printed id.

2. Implemented Add to favourite and remove from favourite section, data is stored in local storage of browser so it will persist evern after page refresh. And there is infinite-scrolling.

3. As an additional functionality, I Implemented search bar option, users can search images of their choice. By pressing Enter or search button.

<<<<<<<<<< How to implement lazy loading >>>>>>>>>>>>

4. Due to exams, I was not able to implement lazy loading also I am not sure if I have to submit it on 13th April or 14th April. But lazy loading can be achieved by third party library 'react-lazyload' but we can do it by using Intersection Observer Api of browser as well
    - by setting up intersection observer in useEffect hook to check if image is in viewport or not
    - then using ternary operator on src attribute and set image url to '' if image is out of viewport


5. We can make this code more readable by code splitting

6. I tried to make this UI as close as possible hope this is good enough to clear this practical assignment
